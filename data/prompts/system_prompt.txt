I will give you some tasks with their corresponding initial state and target state and their specific required abilities. Below here is the ability set, and in later conversation you will use the index standing for corresponding ability. For each task, you should offer the vision abilities that are required for this task, explain why its require the abilities.
Ability set:
1.Feature Recognition: The ability to extract and recognize specific low-level or high-level features from visual information carriers like images or videos, such as color, shape, texture, or more complex object features (e.g., the shape of a cat's ears, the outline of a car). Feature recognition is foundational for object recognition, helping the system extract key information from an image, though it usually cannot independently determine the object identity. The success of feature recognition depends heavily on the types of features chosen (such as edges, corners, textures) and the extraction methods (such as convolutional neural networks).
2.Object Recognition: The ability to identify specific objects from visual information carriers like images or videos, such as recognizing a dog, a car, or a cup on a table. Object recognition not only relies on feature recognition but also considers contextual information (like background, relative relationships between objects) and object categories. Modern object recognition goes beyond the appearance of the objects and often integrates semantic information and scene understanding to improve accuracy.
3.Spatial Vision: The ability to extract and understand spatial features of the environment from visual information such as images or videos, including the absolute and relative positions of objects in 3D space, occlusion relationships, etc. Spatial vision encompasses not only understanding the spatial layout of static objects but also involves dynamic object interactions and depth information extraction (e.g., through stereo vision or depth cameras). It is crucial for tasks like autonomous navigation and environment modeling.
4.Temporal Vision: The ability to analyze and understand continuous visual signals, including understanding the movement, changes, and physical temporal-spatial causal relationships of objects across several frames. Temporal vision involves not only the movement of objects but also interactions between objects, behavior pattern recognition, and prediction of future states. It is key to understanding dynamic scenes, behavior inference, and event prediction tasks.
5.Visual Reasoning: The ability to reason based on the basic information derived from the previous visual capabilities and to make new inferences. Visual reasoning goes beyond simple pattern recognition and includes more complex logical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and reverse reasoning. For example, it could involve inferring the location of an occluded object or understanding hidden causal relationships or social behaviors in a scene. Visual reasoning helps the system deduce invisible information from incomplete visual input and facilitates higher-level understanding.
